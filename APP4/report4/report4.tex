\section{Introduction}
We want optimal. Naive approach - exponential, we use dynamic instead and yata-yata-yata. $D$ is the dictionary with latin characters, $\mathcal{D}$ is its translation into Morse. We suppose that $\epsilon \notin D$.

\section{Principle}

We denote the Morse sequence by $m=(m_0\dots m_{L-1})$. $m[i,j]$ denotes the subsequence $(m_i\dots m_{j-1})$. The proposed dynamic procedure is based on the following observation:\\
Let $w$ be a word of the dictionary such that its unique translation into Morse alphabet $w'$ of length $|w'|$ occurs in $m$ at index $i>0$ (i.e. $m[i,i+|w'|]=w'$). Then the number $C_{i,w'}$ of interpretations of $m[0,i+|w'|]$ where the last word is $w$, equals the number $C_i$ of interpretations of $m[0,i]$.\\
This leads us to establish a recursive formula for $C_i$:
\begin{equation*}
    C_i = \sum_{\substack{w'\in\mathcal{D}\\ m[0,i]=\alpha w'}}{C_{i-|w'|, w'}}\ + F_i = \sum_{\substack{w'\in\mathcal{D}\\ m[0,i]=\alpha w'}}{C_{i-|w'|}}  + F_i
\end{equation*}
where $C_0 = 0$, "$ m[0,i]=\alpha w'$" means that $w'$ is a strict suffix of $m[0,i]$ and
\begin{equation*}
    F_i = |\{w'\in \mathcal{D}\ |\ m[0,i]=w'\}|\quad (note\ that\ F_i = 0\ for\ i>4\times M)
\end{equation*}

\section{Algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}
\begin{algorithmic}
\Procedure{$compute\_number\_sequences$}{$m, L, \mathcal{D}$}
\State $C \leftarrow create\_array(L, 0);$
\For{$i=1\dots L-1$}
    \For{$w' \in \mathcal{D}$}
        \If{$m[i-|w'|,\ i] = w'$} \Comment the word matches the sequence
            \If{$|w'| = i$} \Comment is it the first word in m?
                \State $C[i] = 1$
            \Else
                \State $C[i] += C[i-|w'|]$
            \EndIf
        \EndIf
        
    \EndFor
\EndFor
\State \Return{$C[L-1]$}
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\section{Complexity analysis}
\subsubsection*{Time complexity}
At every iteration inside the innermost loop, aside from some constant-cost operations, we perform an equality check between two strings of length bound by $M$: it costs $O(M)$. In total there are $L\times N$ of those iterations: the total procedure's time cost is in $O(L\times N \times M)$. It is polynomial in all variables.
\subsubsection*{Space complexity}
We have to produce an array of size $L$. Also, if we consider that the dictionary $\mathcal{D}$ of words translated into Morse is not available at the beginning, storing it would cost an additional $O(N\times M)$ overhead -- however, iterating on words of $D$ (rather than $\mathcal{D}$) and translating them on-the-fly would neither increase the asymptotic space complexity nor the time complexity (as it would take $O(M)$ operations each time and would count additively).
\section{Improvements}
The first improvement to the space complexity would consist in storing at any given point only last 80 computed values of $C$, as there can be no words longer than $4\times M = 80$ Morse symbols. For that we should replace $C[x]$ by $C[x\ mod\ 4\times M]$ for all $x$ (as well as $create\_array(L, 0)$ by $create\_array(4\times M, 0)$)
